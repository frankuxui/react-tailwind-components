      Accordion title twoo
    </Accordion.Title>
    <Accordion.Content>
      <p className="mb-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
        Flowbite is first conceptualized and designed using the Figma software so everything you see in the library has a design equivalent in our Figma file.
      </p>
    </Accordion.Content>
  </Accordion.Panel>
  <Accordion.Panel>
    <Accordion.Title>
      Accordion title three
    </Accordion.Title>
    <Accordion.Content>
      <p className="mb-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
        The main difference is that the core components from Flowbite are open source under the MIT license, whereas Tailwind UI is a paid product. Another difference is that Flowbite relies on smaller and standalone components, whereas Tailwind UI offers sections of pages.

</Accordion>
